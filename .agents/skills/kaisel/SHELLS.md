# Shells

You're building an app with a bottom nav bar or sidebar, and each
tab should keep its own history — leave a tab mid-flow, come back,
and it's exactly where you left it.

Reference for `KaiselBranchedShell` (multi-branch tab/sidebar layouts)
and `KaiselShell` (single-branch layouts that just wrap content in
chrome). This is kaisel's **nested routing**: each branch runs its own
stack on a nested Navigator, and branches are **parallel routes** — every
tab's stack stays alive and preserves its state while another tab is
visible. (Coming from go_router, this is the `StatefulShellRoute`
territory; from auto_route, nested routers.) Branched shells are the more common case — start there if
the app has a bottom navigation bar, a sidebar, or any other "this is
the persistent chrome, and the content swaps based on the selected
section" pattern.

**Screen-view analytics across branches:** an observer belongs to one
navigator, so its own de-duplication is per-branch — A → B → A re-logs A.
For a single app-wide signal use `onScreenChanged` on the config, which
reports the active branch's top (never the route hosting the shell) and
de-duplicates across every navigator.

## Quick reference

| Type | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `KaiselBranchedShell` | Widget that hosts N branches; renders the active branch's content inside chrome you supply. |
| `KaiselBranch<R>` | One branch with its own typed router. `KaiselBranch.adaptive(...)` for absorbing layouts. |
| `BranchedShellRouter` | State aggregator for the branches — tracks active branch, exposes a `switchTo` API, notifies on changes. |
| `KaiselBranchedShellChromeBuilder` | `Widget Function(BuildContext, int activeBranch, Widget branchContent, void Function(int) switchBranch)` — builds the chrome around the active branch. |
| `KaiselShell` | Multi-branch shell where **all branches share one route type** `R` (homogeneous). Simpler than `KaiselBranchedShell` when per-branch typing isn't needed. Creates its own `ShellRouter` internally from `branchInitials`. |
| `ShellRouter` | State container for a `KaiselShell` — N branches over a single `R`, plus the active index. Built internally by `KaiselShell`; you don't construct it. |
| `KaiselShellChromeBuilder` | `Widget Function(BuildContext, int activeBranch, Widget branchContent, void Function(int) switchBranch)` — same 4-arg shape as the branched chrome builder. |

## Branched shell — the canonical pattern

The recommended setup is the declarative `KaiselBranchedShell.specs(...)`.
You describe each branch as a `KaiselBranchSpec<R>` and the shell
**creates, owns, and disposes** one `KaiselRouter` per spec — you never
construct a `KaiselRouter` or a `BranchedShellRouter`, and each branch's
stack still survives tab switches.

```dart
sealed class HomeRoute extends KaiselRoute { const HomeRoute(); }
final class HomeView extends HomeRoute { const HomeView(); }

sealed class ProductRoute extends KaiselRoute { const ProductRoute(); }
final class ProductList extends ProductRoute { const ProductList(); }
final class ProductDetail extends ProductRoute {
  const ProductDetail(this.id);
  final String id;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [id];
}

sealed class SettingsRoute extends KaiselRoute { const SettingsRoute(); }
final class SettingsHome extends SettingsRoute { const SettingsHome(); }

KaiselBranchedShell.specs(
  branches: [
    KaiselBranchSpec<HomeRoute>(
      initial: const HomeView(),
      builder: (context, route) => switch (route) {
        HomeView() => const HomeScreen(),
      },
    ),
    KaiselBranchSpec<ProductRoute>(
      initial: const ProductList(),
      builder: (context, route) => switch (route) {
        ProductList() => const ProductListScreen(),
        ProductDetail(:final id) => ProductDetailScreen(id: id),
      },
    ),
    KaiselBranchSpec<SettingsRoute>(
      initial: const SettingsHome(),
      builder: (context, route) => switch (route) {
        SettingsHome() => const SettingsScreen(),
      },
    ),
  ],
  chromeBuilder: (context, activeBranch, branchContent, switchBranch) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: branchContent,
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
        currentIndex: activeBranch,
        onTap: switchBranch,
        items: const [
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.shop), label: 'Shop'),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.settings), label: 'Settings'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  },
  // optional: initialBranch:
);
```

Each spec accepts optional `guards:`, `pageWrapper:`, and `scope:`. For
an adaptive (absorbing) page builder, use the
`KaiselBranchSpec<R>.adaptive(initial:, builder:)` constructor.

**Lower tier — the explicit form.** When you need to hold the branch
routers yourself, construct each `KaiselRouter`, wire them into a
`BranchedShellRouter`, and pass `KaiselBranch<R>(router:, pageBuilder:)`
entries. You own disposal in this form.

```dart
class _AppShellState extends State<AppShell> {
  late final _homeRouter =
      KaiselRouter<HomeRoute>(initial: const HomeView());
  late final _productRouter =
      KaiselRouter<ProductRoute>(initial: const ProductList());
  late final _settingsRouter =
      KaiselRouter<SettingsRoute>(initial: const SettingsHome());

  late final _shell = BranchedShellRouter(
    branches: [_homeRouter, _productRouter, _settingsRouter],
  );

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _shell.dispose();
    _homeRouter.dispose();
    _productRouter.dispose();
    _settingsRouter.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return KaiselBranchedShell(
      shell: _shell,
      branches: [
        KaiselBranch<HomeRoute>(
          router: _homeRouter,
          pageBuilder: (c, r) => switch (r) {
            HomeView() => const HomeScreen(),
          },
        ),
        KaiselBranch<ProductRoute>(
          router: _productRouter,
          pageBuilder: (c, r) => switch (r) {
            ProductList() => const ProductListScreen(),
            ProductDetail(:final id) => ProductDetailScreen(id: id),
          },
        ),
        KaiselBranch<SettingsRoute>(
          router: _settingsRouter,
          pageBuilder: (c, r) => switch (r) {
            SettingsHome() => const SettingsScreen(),
          },
        ),
      ],
      chromeBuilder: (context, activeBranch, branchContent, switchBranch) {
        return Scaffold(
          body: branchContent,
          bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
            currentIndex: activeBranch,
            onTap: switchBranch,
            items: const [
              BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
              BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.shop), label: 'Shop'),
              BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.settings), label: 'Settings'),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

**Rules:**

- Each branch's router is typed to *that branch's* sealed family
  (`KaiselRouter<HomeRoute>`, not `KaiselRouter<AppRoute>`). This is
  the load-bearing per-branch typing the library is designed around.
- The order of `branches` in `BranchedShellRouter` and in the
  `KaiselBranchedShell.branches` list must match — index 0 in one is
  index 0 in the other.
- Always dispose all routers and the shell aggregator. The shell holds
  listeners; leaking it is a real memory bug, not a theoretical one.

## Per-branch typing as compile-time safety

The branch's typed router rejects routes that don't belong to it:

```dart
// Compiler error — HomeRoute doesn't match ProductRoute's branch:
_homeRouter.push(const ProductDetail('sku-42'));

// Compiler accepts — HomeView is a HomeRoute:
_homeRouter.push(const HomeView());
```

This is the type safety go_router and auto_route can't give you even
with codegen — the codegen approach types the *call*, but the router
itself is still typed to the union. kaisel types the branch router
to its specific sub-union, so the type system rejects accidental
cross-branch pushes at the call site.

## Per-branch state preservation

State preservation across branch switches is the default. Each branch's
router keeps its stack between visits. Visit the products tab, push
two details deep, switch to home, switch back — the products tab is
exactly as you left it, including the two details.

This differs from go_router's `ShellRoute` (which loses tab state) and
matches `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`. If you're migrating *from*
a non-stateful shell, the behaviour will be different after the move.
Decide whether you want the new behaviour or whether you need to
explicitly reset stacks on `switchTo`.

If you want to reset a branch on switch, do it in your chrome builder:

```dart
chromeBuilder: (context, activeBranch, branchContent, switchBranch) {
  return Scaffold(
    /* ... */
    bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
      currentIndex: activeBranch,
      onTap: (i) {
        // Reset the target branch's stack before switching.
        if (i == 1) _productRouter.set(const [ProductList()]);
        switchBranch(i);
      },
      /* ... */
    ),
  );
},
```

## Custom branch layout (`branchContentBuilder`)

By default the shell lays the branches out in an `IndexedStack` — that's
what keeps every branch mounted so the state preservation above works.
Pass `branchContentBuilder` to swap that for any container (a `PageView`
for swipeable tabs, a custom animated switcher, …) without giving up the
shell's back-button routing, scopes, or URL wiring:

```dart
KaiselBranchedShell.specs(
  branches: [/* ... */],
  branchContentBuilder: (context, activeBranch, branches, switchBranch) {
    return PageView(
      controller: _pageController,         // your own, synced to activeBranch
      onPageChanged: switchBranch,         // swipe → switch tab
      children: branches,
    );
  },
  chromeBuilder: (context, active, branchContent, switchBranch) =>
      Scaffold(body: branchContent /* ... */),
)
```

The builder receives the active index, the per-branch widgets (in branch
order), and the tab switcher — the same pieces the default `IndexedStack`
uses.

> **You take over state preservation.** `IndexedStack` keeps every branch
> alive; a plain `PageView` lazily builds and disposes off-screen pages, so
> branch stacks reset unless you keep them mounted (e.g. `PageView` with
> `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` on the branch children, or
> `KeepAlivePageView`-style wrappers). Keep `switchTo`/`activeBranch` and your
> container in sync so back-button routing still targets the visible branch.

## Lazy and deferred branches (`lazy: true`, `KaiselBranchSpec.deferred`)

By default `.specs` builds every branch up front. Pass `lazy: true` to build
each branch the first time it becomes active and keep it alive afterwards — the
eager `IndexedStack` stays the default, so this is opt-in:

```dart
KaiselBranchedShell.specs(
  lazy: true, // build tabs on first visit; kept alive after
  branches: [
    KaiselBranchSpec<HomeRoute>(initial: const HomeRoot(), builder: ...),
    KaiselBranchSpec<ReportsRoute>.deferred(
      initial: const ReportsRoot(),
      loadLibrary: reports.loadLibrary,        // a `deferred as` import's tear-off
      placeholder: const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
      errorBuilder: (context, error, retry) => RetryTile(error, retry),
      builder: (context, route) => reports.ReportsScreen(),
    ),
  ],
  chromeBuilder: (context, active, branchContent, switchBranch) => /* ... */,
)
```

`KaiselBranchSpec.deferred` loads a branch's **code** on first activation, behind
a `deferred as` import: it shows `placeholder` while `loadLibrary` runs, swaps in
the screens once it resolves, and renders `errorBuilder` on failure — the
`errorBuilder` is passed a `retry` callback (a kept-alive branch can't recover on
its own). Keep the branch's route values and `initial` in a non-deferred library
and put only the screens behind the deferred import, so back handling, URL
capture, and deep links keep working while the code loads. `deferred` requires
`lazy: true`.

For a custom lazy container, pass `lazyBranchContentBuilder` (the lazy
counterpart to `branchContentBuilder`): instead of a pre-built widget list it
hands you a `buildBranch(context, index)` callback that materialises a branch on
demand, so you decide which branches to build and keep alive.

## Resolving the right router from context

Inside a branch's screens, `context.router<R>()` resolves to that
branch's router. The type parameter matters:

```dart
// Inside a ProductDetailScreen, this is the product branch's router:
context.router<ProductRoute>().pop();

// This would be the *main* router (if accessible), not the branch's:
context.router<AppRoute>().pop();
```

If you need to mutate the top-level state (logout, switch shell route),
use `context.router<AppRoute>()`. If you need to navigate within the
current branch, use the branch's type.

`context.shell()` returns a `KaiselShellController` from any descendant
of the shell — one accessor for either shell flavour. It exposes
`switchTo(i)`, `activeBranch`, `branchCount`, and `current` (the active
branch's `KaiselNavigator`, which carries its stack, `canPop`, and
`pop`).

**`context.router<R>()` does NOT work inside the `chromeBuilder`.** Each
branch's `RouterScope<R>` is installed *inside* its branch, which is
a **descendant** of the chrome — and context lookups only walk upward. There
is also no single "branch router" at the chrome level: the chrome wraps every
branch, each with a different `R`. From the chrome:

- use the `activeBranch` / `switchBranch` arguments you're handed, or
  `context.shell()` for the controller (`switchTo`, `activeBranch`,
  `branchCount`, `current`). Read the active branch's stack, `canPop`,
  and `pop` through `context.shell().current`;
- `context.router<AppRoute>()` (your root route type) resolves to the **main**
  router — it sits above the shell — so use it to push onto the root stack from
  the chrome.

`context.router<BranchR>()` only resolves inside that branch's screens.

## Homogeneous shells (`KaiselShell`)

`KaiselShell<R>` is the simpler sibling of `KaiselBranchedShell`: every
branch shares **one** route type `R`, so there's no per-branch typing.
It builds its own `ShellRouter` internally from `branchInitials` — you
don't construct one, and there's no `shell:` parameter.

**A screen that is both a tab and a full screen needs two route values.**
This follows from the scoping rule below, and it looks like duplication until
you see why. A "recipients" screen might be a bottom-nav tab (no app bar of
its own — the shell chrome supplies one) *and* be reachable as a full screen
from a settings drawer (its own app bar, covering the bottom bar). Those are
genuinely different navigation states, so each family gets a value:

```dart
final class RecipientsTab extends DashboardTabRoute { const RecipientsTab(); }
final class Recipients extends AppRoute { const Recipients(); }
```

Both build the same page widget with different chrome. The alternative —
one value in two families — isn't expressible, and shouldn't be: pushing the
tab's value onto the main stack would render a tab body with no shell around
it.

**Critical: `R` must be a sealed type scoped to the shell's routes, not
your app-wide `AppRoute`.** The `pageBuilder` switch is exhaustive over
`R`; if `R` is `AppRoute`, the switch has to handle *every* route the app
has, not just the tabs — which is impractical and defeats the point.
Define a dedicated sealed type for the shell, mounted at a marker route:

```dart
// Dedicated sealed type for the shell's branches.
sealed class TabRoute extends KaiselRoute { const TabRoute(); }
final class HomeRoot extends TabRoute { const HomeRoot(); }
final class DiscoverRoot extends TabRoute { const DiscoverRoot(); }
final class ProfileRoot extends TabRoute { const ProfileRoot(); }

KaiselShell<TabRoute>(
  branchInitials: const [HomeRoot(), DiscoverRoot(), ProfileRoot()],
  pageBuilder: (context, route) => switch (route) {
    HomeRoot() => const HomeScreen(),
    DiscoverRoot() => const DiscoverScreen(),
    ProfileRoot() => const ProfileScreen(),
    // exhaustive over TabRoute — add a variant for anything a tab pushes
  },
  chromeBuilder: (context, activeBranch, branchContent, switchBranch) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: branchContent,
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
        currentIndex: activeBranch,
        onTap: switchBranch,
        items: const [/* ... */],
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

Inside a branch screen, `context.router<TabRoute>()` resolves to the
active branch's router and `context.shell()` to the shell controller
(`switchTo`, `activeBranch`, `branchCount`, `current`). The trade-off
vs. `KaiselBranchedShell`: every branch
shares `TabRoute`, so the compiler can't stop you pushing a "profile"
route into the "home" tab. When tabs need **different** route types (and
that compile-time guard), use `KaiselBranchedShell` with per-branch
sealed types.

## Observers and tab switches

The app-level `observers:` builder is invoked fresh for every navigator,
so pushes and pops inside any branch already reach your observers (e.g.
`FirebaseAnalyticsObserver`) with no per-branch wiring. A tab switch
changes the visible screen without any Navigator route event — only the
branch container's index moves — so both shells report it to your
observers as a `didReplace` from the old branch's visible top to the new
one's. Equal tops don't report, and in-branch navigation is never
double-reported.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|:--------|:----|
| Branch routers and `branches` list out of sync | The order in `BranchedShellRouter(branches: [...])` and `KaiselBranchedShell(branches: [...])` must match. Mismatch silently shows the wrong content. |
| Typing all branches to `AppRoute` instead of per-branch sealed types | You lose compile-time prevention of cross-branch pushes. The whole point of per-branch typing evaporates. |
| Holding stale router references after the shell disposes | Routers are owned by the shell's State. Don't store references in singletons or service locators that outlive the shell. |
| Calling `switchTo` on the shell router and `set` on a branch router and expecting them to compose into one atomic operation | They're separate mutations. If you need an atomic "switch branch + replace stack" change, do the `set` first, then `switchTo`. |
| Wrapping the whole `KaiselBranchedShell` in a `Scaffold` and also putting a `Scaffold` inside the `chromeBuilder` | Pick one. Nested `Scaffold`s give you two `SafeArea`s, two `AppBar`s, and confused gesture handling. Convention: the chrome builder owns the `Scaffold`. |
